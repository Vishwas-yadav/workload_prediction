# workload_prediction
This repository contains code for predicting CPU utilization, Memory Utilization using an attention-based LSTM/Bi-LSTM/GRU model and ARIMA model. The experiment was conducted in Google Colab Pro environment.

It contains two folders:

-The 'code' folder contains all the code files along with the respective datasets and model architectures.

-The 'Result_Graph' folder contains all the graphs generated from the experiments that we had performed. Each graph corresponds to a specific experiment and provides insights into the model's performance.
